# CP1404 Practicals Repository

This is the repository for each of my weekly practicals
for the subject CP1404 - Programming II.

## About Me

My name is Callum Riley, and I am currently (as of writing this)
a first-year Bachelor of IT student at James Cook University.

## 3 Lessons About "Clean Code":

- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- If you are already using CONSTANTS for some 'magic numbers',
  be consistent and use CONSTANTS for all other 'magic numbers' (except for 0).
- Use the right tool for the job
