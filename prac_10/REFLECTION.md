# Reflection

## Time Estimates
Over the course of the subject, the accuracy of my time estimations has fluctuated. The closest my actual working times 
have been to my estimations was in the week 6 practical, with the smallest difference in time being `guitar.py`. The
least accurate estimation was in prac 7's `project_management.py`, as I had put 1 day (1440 minutes) as my estimation.
Upon reflection, I should have been more realistic about how long it would take me to complete the task, which is
different to the amount of time I would dedicate to completing the task.

## Code Reviews
Reviewing the code of my peers has helped improve my attention to detail as well as confidence in knowing what to do and
what to avoid in coding. Furthermore, having others review my code has helped me improve my code's readability and 
efficiency, as well as my ability to identify both small and large mistakes in my code.


## Practical Tasks
Regarding the practical tasks in general, it's difficult to say what I would change. I appreciated the order of tasks in
the practicals, and the Quick Questions portion from *Problem-Solving and Programming I* became the weekly online tests.
Although included in some practical tasks, perhaps there could have been more handwritten code in preparation for the
final exam.
